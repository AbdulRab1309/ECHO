      "The Arduino UNO Q carries forward the unmistakable UNO silhouette — the same 68.6 × 53.4 mm board outline, the same digital pin 13 LED — while rebuilding everything underneath. A 32-bit Renesas RA4M1 handles the I/O, a dedicated ESP32-S3 co-processor delivers Wi-Fi 4 and Bluetooth 5, and a USB-C port replaces the aging Type-B. The result is a board that drops into legacy UNO projects unchanged but is finally fast enough for modern work: motor control loops under 100µs, on-board BLE peripherals, and 12-bit analog that doesn't fight you. Available with a 3D-rotatable model for inspection before you buy.",
